# Project Abstract
My digital humanities project is an analysis of PISA scores. PISA, or Program for International Student Assessment, is an exam that measures 15-year-oldsâ€™ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.

# Research Question 

Can we use this dataset to explore the gender gap within schools? For example, are there specific trends that show girls or boys performing better in specific topics? If there are certain countries where one gender does better than another, why might that be?

# Analysis and Results 

Generally, I found that boys did better in math and girls did better in reading. In science, they were about equal. 

While this project cannot definitivity conclude whether boys or girls are "smarter" than another (in fact, the definition of intelligence is probably too complex to even capture in a single score), it does give insights into how there might be gender bias or inequity within educational systems. It seems like boys generally do better in traditionally "male" subjects (i.e, STEM), while girls do better in traditionally "female" subjects (humanities).
